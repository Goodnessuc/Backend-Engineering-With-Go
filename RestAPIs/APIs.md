## What are APIs
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are mediums of communication between two applications. APIs are 
written using REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, and accessed via the CLI (Command LIne Interface).

There are different types of web services. The four most prominent include:

- Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
- Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI)
- Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
- Representational State Transfer (REST)

## SOAP API
SOAP was used in the early 2000s when XML was in vogue as a data format -- now JSON has taken over. Soap requests have 
three components:
- envelope
- header
- body
